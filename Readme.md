# My Dynamic GitHub Portfolio (Envoy-Portfolio)

[![GitHub Pages Deploy](https://github.com/Envoyofhell/Envoy-Portfolio/actions/workflows/build-portfolio.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Envoyofhell/Envoy-Portfolio/actions/workflows/build-portfolio.yml)

**Live Demo:** [https://envoyofhell.github.io/Envoy-Portfolio/](https://envoyofhell.github.io/Envoy-Portfolio/)

This project is a dynamic portfolio website designed to automatically showcase my GitHub projects. It leverages GitHub Actions for data generation and deployment to GitHub Pages, displaying both public repositories and selected information from private repositories.

## Features

* **Dynamic Repository Listing:** Automatically fetches and displays public repositories from your GitHub profile (and an optional organization).
* **Private Repository Showcase (Optional & Secure):** Uses a GitHub Action to securely fetch specified details (like name and homepage/website link) from your private repositories and makes only that selected information available for display in the `private_repo_data.json` file.
* **Automated Build & Deployment:** Employs GitHub Actions to:
    * Generate the `private_repo_data.json` file.
    * Deploy the latest version of the portfolio to GitHub Pages automatically on pushes to the main branch.
* **Client-Side Rendering:** Fetches repository data and renders the project cards directly in the browser using vanilla JavaScript.
* **Configurable:** Easily customize which repositories are displayed or excluded via the `index.html` configuration.

## How It Works
 
1.  **`index.html` (Frontend):**
    * This is the main page that structures the portfolio.
    * It contains client-side JavaScript to fetch and display repository information.
    * Public repository data is fetched directly from the GitHub API in the browser.
    * Private repository information is fetched from the `private_repo_data.json` file, which is generated by the GitHub Action.

2.  **GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/build-portfolio.yml`):**
    * **Trigger:** Runs automatically on pushes to the `main` branch or can be manually triggered.
    * **Data Generation for Private Repos:**
        * Executes a Node.js script.
        * This script uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) (stored securely as the `GH_PAT_FOR_PAGES` repository secret) to fetch details about your private repositories via the GitHub API.
        * It then creates the `private_repo_data.json` file containing only the necessary, pre-approved information (name, html_url, homepage).
    * **Artifact Creation:** Bundles `index.html`, `private_repo_data.json`, CSS, and any other static assets.
    * **Deployment:** Deploys the bundled artifact to the `gh-pages` environment, making it live on GitHub Pages.

## Configuration Guide

To adapt or set up this portfolio for your own use:

1.  **`index.html` Customization:**
    * Open `index.html`.
    * Locate the `<script>` section near the bottom.
    * **`YOUR_GITHUB_PROFILE_URL`**: Update this variable with your GitHub profile URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YourUsername`).
    * **`YOUR_ORGANIZATION_GITHUB_URL`**: (Optional) If you want to display repositories from a GitHub organization you belong to, set this variable to the organization's GitHub URL. Leave as an empty string (`""`) if not used.
    * **`EXCLUDED_REPOS`**: This JavaScript array lists repository names (strings) that you wish to hide from the portfolio. Add any public or private repository names here.

2.  **GitHub Actions Secrets (for Private Repositories Feature):**
    * **Generate a PAT:** Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) (Classic) in your GitHub account settings (`Settings` > `Developer settings` > `Personal access tokens` > `Tokens (classic)`).
        * **Scope:** Grant it the **`repo`** scope. This allows it to read your repository information, including private ones.
        * **Copy the token immediately** as it won't be shown again.
    * **Add to Repository Secrets:** In your GitHub repository (`Envoyofhell/Envoy-Portfolio`), go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
        * Create a new repository secret named `GH_PAT_FOR_PAGES`.
        * Paste your newly generated PAT as the value for this secret.

3.  **GitHub Pages Settings:**
    * In your repository settings, go to the `Pages` section.
    * Ensure the "Source" for "Build and deployment" is set to **"GitHub Actions"**.

4.  **Modifying Private Data Fetching (Advanced):**
    * The Node.js script responsible for creating `private_repo_data.json` is embedded within the `.github/workflows/build-portfolio.yml` file.
    * Currently, it fetches specific details for all private repositories accessible by the PAT. If you need more fine-grained control (e.g., fetching only private repos with a certain topic, or excluding some private repos directly in the script), you'll need to modify this Node.js script.
